# coding-quiz
The following challenge focused on building a multiple choice quiz site from scratch with HTML,CSS, and JS. Focusing on how to appendchild answers to questions, saving scores to local storage, and timed intervals. The hardest part for building the quiz for me was getting the answers to match up with the user's target choice, I tried 3 different ways of inputting the answer until I got the code to work how I wanted to (forgot that the child element started at 0, not 1).
